# Image Compression using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)

[cite_start]This project focuses on the implementation of a digital image compression and decompression algorithm using the **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)**, a specific application of Fourier analysis[cite: 2, 4, 26]. [cite_start]Developed as part of a Signal and Image Processing course at **Polytech Nice Sophia - Université Côte d'Azur**[cite: 10, 11, 15].

## Overview

[cite_start]The program utilizes Python to compress and decompress digital images by transforming spatial data into frequency components[cite: 26, 34]. [cite_start]By decomposing images into $8 \times 8$ pixel blocks and applying a frequency base change, the algorithm effectively reduces file size by eliminating high-frequency information that is less perceptible to the human eye[cite: 36, 67, 70].

## Key Features

* [cite_start]**DCT-II Implementation:** Uses the Discrete Cosine Transform to switch from the spatial domain to the frequency domain[cite: 35, 82].
* [cite_start]**RGB Support:** Processes standard Red, Green, and Blue color channels by decomposing the image into three planes[cite: 16, 103].
* [cite_start]**Low-Pass Filtering:** Includes a configurable low-pass filter to remove noise and high-frequency data based on a cutoff frequency $\omega_c$[cite: 72, 74, 110].
* [cite_start]**Quantization:** Implements a quantization matrix $Q$ to optimize compression rates[cite: 66, 86]. [cite_start]The intensity of compression can be adjusted by a factor $k$[cite: 314].
* [cite_start]**Performance Metrics:** Automatically calculates the compression ratio and the relative error using the Frobenius norm[cite: 89, 124, 131].

## Algorithm Workflow

1.  [cite_start]**Initialization:** The image is truncated to multiples of 8, and intensities are centered from $[0, 255]$ to $[-128, 127]$[cite: 80, 81].
2.  **Compression:**
    * [cite_start]The image is divided into $8 \times 8$ blocks[cite: 84].
    * [cite_start]Change of base: $D = P M P^T$ (where $P$ is the DCT matrix)[cite: 40, 85, 99].
    * [cite_start]Quantization: $D$ is divided by $Q$ and rounded to the nearest integer to eliminate high frequencies[cite: 66, 67, 101].
3.  **Decompression:**
    * [cite_start]Inverse quantization: Multiply the coefficients back by $Q$[cite: 90, 116].
    * [cite_start]Inverse DCT: Apply $M = P^T D P$ to return to the spatial domain[cite: 91, 118].
    * [cite_start]Data recentering ($+128$) and normalization[cite: 119, 120].

## Results & Performance

[cite_start]The project demonstrates that compression is highly effective on simple or uniform images compared to highly textured ones[cite: 250, 251].

| Image Type | Compression Rate | Relative Error |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Low Texture (e.g., Waves) | [cite_start]~96.5% [cite: 247] | [cite_start]~1.8% [cite: 248] |
| High Texture (e.g., Clovers) | [cite_start]~66.2% [cite: 244] | [cite_start]~13.8% [cite: 245] |

### Execution Time
* [cite_start]**JPEG Processing:** Generally faster (~0.04s compression) as the format is already optimized for lossy compression[cite: 294, 306].
* [cite_start]**PNG Processing:** Takes longer (~0.11s compression) due to the higher information density of lossless formats[cite: 296, 307].
* [cite_start]**Decompression:** Consistently faster than compression across all tests as it requires fewer analytical calculations[cite: 310, 311].

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* [cite_start]NumPy (for matrix operations) [cite: 99]
* Matplotlib (for results visualization)
